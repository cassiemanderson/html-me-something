            <p>I was fortunate enough to visit a friend from college who moved to Long Island after she graduated. We visited some of the most iconic tourist destinations in New York City, including the Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island, and Times Square for New Years Eve.</p>

            <p> The summer after I graduated from college I was offered an internship in Greece. The internship was based out of a coastal town named <em>Kavala</em>. I spent most of the summer on a Greek island named <em>Thassos</em> where I was a sports coach for a summer camp.</p>
            <p>On days away from the camp, we were able to visit a castle in Kavala and an ancient acropolis on the island.</p>

            <p>My last year of college I was able to study broad in Costa Rica. While I was there I volunteered at a sea turtle hatchery in Montezuma. I also volunteered at a YMCA and helped children learn English.</p>
